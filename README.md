This is the 4ยบ version of this addon. Released in 08/02/2012.

Fixes:
- "Unfortunately, it is not possible to display Prefixes which do not have 1 thread. Would be great to also show Prefixes with zero threads." (http://xenforo.com/community/threads/pfps-com-br-thread-prefix-listing.22091/page-2#post-297441)
- Question when I update it doesn't show a version number change in the Add-ons list. Is this normal? How do I know I'm using the newest version with this add-on? (http://xenforo.com/community/threads/thread-prefix-
- The sort per diplay order is reversed, from big to low, is it possible to switch it in the correct way? (http://xenforo.com/community/threads/thread-prefix-listing.26811/#post-324081)listing.26811/#post-322608)
[b]Resolved UI[/b] - Too many prefixes it will go to multiple lines and there are some overlapping. (http://xenforo.com/community/threads/thread-prefix-listing.26811/#post-322591)
- Sorting prefixes by title was sorting in a wrong way. This is now fixed.
- Fixed some issues with performance when loading the prefixes.


New:
- Added an option to choose the margin bottom of the prefixes. This is related with the above resolved UI.
- Added an option to choose the order direction (ASC, DESC).
- Minimum of Threads Count - Choose here the minimum of thread count of each prefix that can be show in the prefix list. If you set this value to 0, for example, all prefixes even with 0 threads will show the count in the right side of it. If you set to 1, only prefixes that have thread count greater then 1 will show the thread count. This will only hide the thread count, not the prefix.
- Show Total Threads Count - Check this option if you want to show the total count of threads of each prefix.
- Added a new option to set the text to show right before the prefix list. You can let the field in blank to not show the text.
- Ammount of Prefixes - Set the ammount of prefixes to show. With this option you can limit the ammount of prefixes by what you want. If you set this option to 5, only 5 prefixes will me shown in the list. Set 0 to unlimited prefixes.
- Cache the ammount of threads of each prefix. Everytime a new threads with prefix X is created only the cache of that prefix is rebuilt. This helps to do less queries when listing the prefixes.
